This directory contains code-snippets from the Android Dalvik implementation and the TaintDroid
additions to that project. This is why some of the files contain the standard Apache header comment.
Some of those files were modified to match our usecase but this includes mainly deletions.

Here is the combined header comment for those files:

/*
 * Access .dex (Dalvik Executable Format) files.  The code here assumes that
 * the DEX file has been rewritten (byte-swapped, word-aligned) and that
 * the contents can be directly accessed as a collection of C arrays.  Please
 * see docs/dalvik/dex-format.html for a detailed description.
 *
 * The structure and field names were chosen to match those in the DEX spec.
 *
 * It's generally assumed that the DEX file will be stored in shared memory,
 * obviating the need to copy code and constant pool entries into newly
 * allocated storage.  Maintaining local pointers to items in the shared area
 * is valid and encouraged.
 *
 * All memory-mapped structures are 32-bit aligned unless otherwise noted.
